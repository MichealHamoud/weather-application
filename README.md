# Weather-Dashboard

For this weeks challenge I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard using OpenWeather One Call API. Using this data, I would then create a UI that allows a user to input data to search for a city's five day weather forecast and save the locations picked in local storage. A user could then interact with buttons created with JavaScript to look back at recent searches.
